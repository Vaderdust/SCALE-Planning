Scaling PostgreSQL Queries with Stado
Jim Mlodgenski
Stado provides a powerful and flexible analytical environment allowing users to process large amounts of data using a shared-nothing, massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture with PostgreSQL and PostGIS. Data is automatically partitioned across multiple nodes and each node processes its subset of data allowing queries to be distributed across the cluster and run in parallel. This fully open source architecture allows database performance to scale linearly as servers are added to the cluster while appearing as a single database to applications.

The MySQL Storage Engines Landscape
Colin Charles
A unique selling point of MySQL is that is supports multiple storage engines, which basically means users get to use the same top-level SQL interface while storing their data in many different sorts of methods. There is a storage engine API that was well nurtured, and a myriad of companies continuing on with creating opensource & commercial storage engines, with the API being extended in forks like MariaDB. Which engine is right for your workload? Do you choose a mix or just stick with something default like MyISAM or InnoDB? This and more will be answered in the talk.

Messaging Free Software
Deb Nicholson
It's easy to talk with people who already "get" you, but how do you open the conversation about free software with someone who's never heard of it? This talk is for people who are interested in refining their message and more effectively sharing their excitement about the free software movement.

Keynote: Amazon and the Future of the Open Cloud
Greg DeKoenigsberg
mazon Web Services is the dominant public cloud provider in the industry.  And for good reason: they make it dead simple to get up and running in the cloud.  Lock-in risks in the public cloud world, though, are enormous: what alternatives will users have if, for whatever reason, they decide that Amazon services are no longer for
them?  How do we leverage the freedom of choice provided by open source in a cloud world that is increasingly dominated by a single entity?

Practice Penetration Testing on Your Home Router
Kyle Rankin
While it is fun to learn how to hack, sometimes it's tough to practice your skills without breaking any laws. It turns out if you have any consumer devices on your local network, you already have everything you need to practice penetration testing. In this talk I will discuss my experience with the Dlink DIR-685 Wireless N router and how with just a few basic skills I was able to find multiple exploits, including one that gave me root, all through the web interface. As I describe the attacks I'll demonstrate the exploits with a live demo.

Intro to Python

Performance Analysis: New Tools and Concepts from The Cloud
Brendan Gregg
Cloud Computing introduces new challenges for performance analysis, for both customers and operators of the cloud. Apart from monitoring a scaling environment, issues within a system can be complicated when tenants are competing for the same resources, and are invisible to each other. Other factors include rapidly changing production code and wildly unpredictable traffic surges. For performance analysis in the Joyent public cloud, we use a variety of tools including Dynamic Tracing, which allows us to create custom tools and metrics and to explore new concepts.



Installing Eucalyptus: Past, Present, and Future
David Kavanagh
From the start, Eucalyptus has been installed using a set of instructions that walked the user through various options, from distro to hypervisor to network mode. While there is still value in that for the ultimate flexibility, there are other ways to get Eucalyptus installed. FastStart is one such technology. It uses a set of simplifying assumptions to create a POC installer. For those who want to not only provision Eucalyptus, but handle ongoing configuration management, Puppet and Silvereye can help to take things to the next level.

Dana Ross, a lifelong working professional, shares his experience, recommendations and tips for using Open Source Software when your career and livelihood depend on it.

Linux Based Personal Robotics
Tully Foote
ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. In building ROS we use Linux both as a platform and a model for development. As a platform Linux provides a great development environment and tools in addition to well packaged libraries which are tested and integrated. As a model for development, the open source community built up around Linux is one of the most productive ways to develop.

Cloud Computing for Small Business
Thomas Stocking
Thomas Stocking will talk about the uses of Linux and open source in cloud computing, and how small businesses can take advantage of the cloud. With a short review of what the cloud means to small business, we will discuss a couple of general use cases for public and private clouds. We will also cover SaaS, and how small businesses can use it to get online and sell products, software, and services. In Q&A, participants will be asked what use they have made of cloud computing, and how it has worked (or failed) to enable their small business ventures.

State of the OpenStack
Jesse Andrews
Because OpenStack abstracts servers, networks and storage to a single restful API, integrating it with your system(s) can be an ordeal. Lessons learned in the field with real deployments at Sony Computer Entertainment America and x.commerce. To help getting it to work for you, we will explore the architecture of major components and how to setup a complete development environment using devstack, a documented shell script that goes from Ubuntu to a running cloud in 5 minutes.

Modern Memcached
Alan Kasindorf
Memcached was an original high speed networked key/value store developed by LiveJournal. Over time many new ideas have spring up around the idea of key/value storage: persistence, autoscaling, schemas. The memcached protocol is even used as a side protocol for new versions of MySQL. Recently development has picked up pace, as the project continues to push the envelope for high performance and simplicity. Come hear about the new changes from the project developer also known as Dormando.

12 Years of FLOSS License Compliance: A Historical Perspective
Bradley Kuhn
Since working on his first GPL enforcement effort in 1999 Kuhn has tracked and followed the state of compliance with the GPL and LGPL. Kuhn will survey the types of FLOSS compliance problems that were and are encountered, and how they have changed historically.

Much progress has been made since late 1990s, but widespread adoption of BusyBox/Linux and Android/Linux systems has led to more GPL violations than ever before (counting by sheer volume) particularly in embedded products.  Kuhn will discuss how our community can meet these challenges and improve worldwide compliance.

Remote Execution Management with Salt
Christer Edwards
Salt is a distributed remote execution system used to execute commands and query data. It was developed in order to bring the best solutions found in the world of remote execution together and make them better, faster and more malleable.

Automotive: the Next Frontier for Mobile Linux
Alison Chaiken
Desktop, laptop, phone, tablet . . . car! Which OS will dominate car "in-vehicle infotainment" systems: Windows, Android Linux, WebOS, GNU/Linux or a traditional embedded choice like Angstrom? What are the associated opportunities for app developers and systems programmers?

The automotive business model diverges significantly from that of consumer electronics, giving GNU/Linux some advantages over Android. Who are the players in automotive Linux? What are their plans? What reference hardware is suitable for testing car apps? I'll show a simple IVI demo running on an x86 tablet.

FUSE with In-Kernel Meta-Data Caching
Gordon Ross
An alternative to the traditional FUSE design is presented, where the kernel file-system module can do meta-data caching and some aggregation of requests, allowing the rendez-vous with the user-level helper process to be less frequent and more efficient. Experimental results from a prototype of this design are compared with the more traditional implementation.

Care and Feeding of a MySQL database for Linux Administrators

The new project is releasing code from a community of interested people and vendors you recognize.

Advanced web content management with revision control
Don Marti
The new generation of web content management systems uses a revision control system such as git, Mercurial, or Perforce, instead of a relational database, for storage. We'll cover systems such as ikiwiki, jekyll, and Perforce Chronicle, and see examples of advanced workflow enabled by revision control--while regular users see a simple wiki-like or WYSIWYG interface. We'll also learn to extend a revision-control-backed WCM system with powerful "PageSpec" expressions or ORM-like Records.

Giving Linux a boot
Tom Rini
There are many aspects of the Linux boot process developers should consider. This presentation covers all facets of the boot process from power up to running a user application beginning with ROM boot loader progressing through secondary program loader, u-boot, kernel and finishing with user-level initialization. Learn more about the Linux boot process first hand with a live demonstration on one of the popular BeagleBoard.org open source platforms.

Infrastructure Automation with Chef
Sean OMeara
Infrastructure is code. The separation between how you manage infrastructure and applications is disappearing. System administrators love Chef because it gives them flexibility to integrate all aspects of their infrastructure such as monitoring and trending tools with applications. Software developers love Chef because it helps them take care of the muck so they can focus on writing great applications. Get beyond just configuration management. Investigate Chef's architecture and design including tools and capabilities and dissect the anatomy of a Chef run.

Undergraduate Education Strategies
Sebastian Dziallas
The FOSS world and academia operate on radically different schedules -- integrating the two together requires a lot of work. But it can be incredibly rewarding, to both parties. This session will articulate how all of us can work together to make these collaborations better -- and more often. Finally, I'll report the latest results from the POSSE workshop that happened this summer, and that's been submitted in an intensive-version on this conference as well. Join us for the revolution!


POSSE intensive -- a cultural immersion workshop
Sebastian Dziallas
Working in the open source world can be a daunting proposition. Not everybody has the time to learn about the means, tools and most importantly the culture this world employs. If youâ€™re someone with skills that would benefit an open source project â€“ developer, sysadmin, designer, writer, marketer, lawyer, tester, and nearly anything else under the sun â€“ but have a hard time figuring out how to interact with the communities you want to work with, this workshop is for you. Originally designed for professors getting their students started as contributors, we're opening it to the public.

State of Real-time I/O Processing in Embedded Linux Systems.
Tom King
Real-time I/O is important in embedded systems as many of the systems are used for process control. There are two approaches to handling real-time: the Kernel Approach: using RTAI, Xenomi, or PREEMPT_RT and the Hardware Approach: Embedded Micro, FPGA/CPLD (programmable logic). Discussion of pros and cons of both approaches, as well as, current best practices.

Don't be an *aaS: Why Community and Open Source Matter in The Cloud
Robyn Bergeron
"Open" and "Cloud" may be the two of the most overused buzz words in technology today -- and certainly also two words with a vast number of interpretations of meaning. In this session, Robyn (as a Service!) will explore the intersections of these two paradigms, discuss the various layers of Freedom in the cloud atmosphere, and explain *how* and *why* Community Matters Matter in The Cloud.

IPv6 Essentials for Linux Administrators

Functions, Closures, Decorators, Parameterized Decorators, Class Decorators Example Decorators.

The Pop Culture Guide To Open Source
Ruth Suehle
Explaining open source to someone who barely knows what software is can be hard. Code? Community? It's free? But there's a good chance your software un-savvy friend has heard of Harry Potter. Or World of Goo. Maybe he's a Tron fan. And that's the secret to explaining open source--by using the known as a bridge to the unknown.

Aeolus - Clouds Flying in Assembly
David Lutterkort
Aeolus, an umbrella project for several related open source projects, ties all the cloud resources to which an organization has access together; it allows combining all of them, be they in public or private clouds, into one pool of resources, which can be subdivided into multiple virtual clouds with differing access rights for different users. Aeolus provides tools for managing virtual instances and images across public and private clouds and virtualization management solutions, from image creation to the launch of complex deployments. All fronted by a friendly self-service web application.

Developing for illumos
Garrett DAmore
We will present an overview of the tools and APIs that affect device driver developers, including a sample very simple device driver. We will cover the core DDI, resources to find more information, building the software, the tools to load and test drivers, and some high level debugging strategies.

Fundraising 101 (or "Free as in Freedom So Who Pays for the Beer?")
Cat Allman
Free and Open Source software may be largely created and maintained by passionate volunteers, but projects still need funds to pay for things like bandwidth, hardware and the all important tee-shirts. Asking for money is hard â€“ and taking it can be a lot more complicated than you might think.

This talk covers the basics of sourcing financial support for your project. Participants in this session should walk out with the information they need to develop at least the outline of a fund-raising plan for your project.

Reinventing Linux loopback device for clouds
Kir Kolyshkin, Maxim Patlasov
This talk will dÃ©but a new loopback device which gives all the advantages of virtual machine images by storing the container in a file while preserving the benefits of sharing significant portions with the host OS. We will compare and contrast the technology with the traditional loopback device and LVM, and describe a few features of a new loopback useful in container snapshotting and live migration. This talk will be technical in nature but should be accessible to people interested in cloud, virtualisation and container technologies.

Using SmartOS as a Hypervisor
Robert Mustacchi
SmartOS is an open source distribution of illumos, currently in production for Joyent's public cloud, where it provides a hypervisor that is secure, flexible and observable. It leverages technologies such as ZFS snapshots and clones for rapid provisioning, KVM and Zones for hardware and OS virtualization, and DTrace to safely understand what's going on inside of guests and the hypervisor. This talk will describe these technologies and their use, including engineering challenges encountered, and discuss opportunities for observing guests such as Linux and Windows.

Selling Free Software
Tom Callaway
From 2001 to 2006, I was a Sales Engineer (now known as Solutions Architects) at Red Hat, awarded Sales Engineer of the Year in 2005 and 2006. With no roadmap, no sales training, only a hacker mindset and a passion for free software, I learned many things about how to (and how not to) sell Free Software within organizations, large and small. I'll share some tips about how I was successful and hopefully give you some ideas.

Fun with Linux and Devices
Akkana Peck
Robots are hot! Do you ever find yourself wishing you could build a robot or a sensing device, but don't know where to start? This talk will show you how to get started with Arduinos, Linux plug computers and similar options. How do you program these devices, and get them to talk to sensors or motors? Can you use Python? How much do these gizmos cost? You don't need to know a lot about electronics or computer hardware, or about programming -- I'll be showing the steps as I go. Come learn how to have fun controlling hardware from Linux!

SELinux for Mere Mortals (or, "Don't Turn It Off")
Thomas Cameron
This session will cover the history, basic concepts and introduce Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux). Participants will be able to identify, diagnose, and solve common problems with SELinux.


Automated EC2 AMI generation with Puppet
Carl Caum
Cloud computing has brought many benefits to enterprises and startups alike. However, one challenge is to determine when a AMI needs to be updated. If you wait too long between new builds, puppet could potentially take upwards of 15-20 minutes to configure new instances to be ready to do their work. Assuming puppet is what's authoritative in your environment, the release of new production puppet code should begin a process of what images need to be updated.

RetroGnome
Earl Malmrose
With the recent switch to two new desktop environments, Unity and GNOME Shell, a lot of people have been unhappy with the new way of interacting with their desktop. Several attempts have been made to remedy this situation, but those all seem like temporary workarounds.  We will go over the steps to take a default Ubuntu installation, and modify it by installing GNOME Shell and several Extensions that bring back that classic GNOME 2 desktop usability, without losing any of the modern GNOME Shell features.

Ceph distributed storage system
Sage Weil
As the size and performance requirements of storage systems have increased, file system designers have looked to new architectures to facilitate system scalability. Ceph is a fully open source distributed object store, network block device, and file system designed for reliability, performance, and scalability from terabytes to exabytes.

File Security: Lock Down Your Data
Brian Reames
This presentation will begin with an introduction to the concepts of "owner", "group", and "other" as well as "read", "write", and "execute" permissions. With real examples, we will see how complications and undesired access can arise from different permission settings. The special permissions will be introduced as means of surmounting common security issues in collaborative directories. Access Control Lists will be discussed as a means of fine-tuning access granted by standard permissions. The presentation will close with a dicsusssion of how to implement, manage, and determine ACLs.

The Care and Feeding of an Open Source Community
Meghan Gill
An open source project is only as strong as the developer community around it. The traditional marketing strategies may not be applicable when dealing with a more discerning developer audience in the age of social media. So how does an open source project gain traction and usage? This session will examine that question through a case study of the MongoDB project.
